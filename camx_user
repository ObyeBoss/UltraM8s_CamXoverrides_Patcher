#### INSTRUCTIONS ####
# Place this file at the root of your internal storage
# CU will hook your values at first flash if the file already exists on sdcard
# If file doesn't exist - first flash will create the file, you'll be able to set it
# and reflash again for values to hook
#
# Reflash is mandatory every time you change values in this file starting from second flash!
#
# Controls existance highly depends on QC platform & OEM
# so you might consider all settings as experimental
# it's hard to predict which exists and which doesn't.
# I checked sd845/855/865/888 sources could get, so
# can be confident only about these. But even on those
# OEM might not use certain control. You can find stock
# file at /vendor/etc/camera/camxoverridesettings.txt but
# it won't have full list of possible controls. Feel free
# to experiment
